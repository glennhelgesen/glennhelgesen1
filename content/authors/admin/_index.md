As an Logistics Consultant working with two of Norwayâ€™s largest automated wholesaling warehouses I have my key experience in the development and design of WMS and WCS systems within supply chains. Besides working with analytical tasks in this profession, I also like to build and develop machine learning models and create data visualizations using various programming tools on my own. This will also be the primary focus for this page.

Main languages used for analysis will be Python and SQL.

Enjoy and feel free to ask any questions!
